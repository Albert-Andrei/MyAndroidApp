Movie Reviews and Recommendations App

  MyMovieBD - is an app where the user will be able to create a list of movies that they want to see in the future. 
Also, the application will be able to recommend a top of movies and a random movie. Moreover, users will be able to write their opinions on and keep track of 
time and episodes where they stopped.

  Motivation - sometimes I want to watch something and I have to spend some time finding an interesting movie. Moreover when someone asks for an interesting movie to watch it's
hard to remember the name.
